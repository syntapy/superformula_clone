## ðŸš€ Superformula clone
A clone of superformula.com I am doing to learn React and Typescript

I chose Gatsby because it [seems fast](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/comparing-website-performance-gatsby-vs-next-vs-nuxt/), and that seems like a pretty strong requirement for a landing page

Currently WIP, but see the progress at https://superformulaclonemain.gatsbyjs.io/
