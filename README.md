## ðŸš€ Superformula clone
A clone of superformula.com I am doing to learn React and Typescript

I chose Gatsby because it [seems fast](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/comparing-website-performance-gatsby-vs-next-vs-nuxt/), and that seems like a pretty strong requirement for a landing page

Currently WIP, but see the progress at https://superformulaclonemain.gatsbyjs.io/

Main thing I'm proud about on this is my unit tests of CSS styles using [jest-transform-css](https://github.com/dferber90/jest-transform-css) and which I first got working on [PR 21](https://github.com/syntapy/superformula_clone/pull/21)

## Usage

run tests `npm run test`

run dev server: `npm run develop`

run prod server: `npm run serve`
